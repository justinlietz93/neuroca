# NeuroCognitive Architecture (NCA) for LLMs - Project Overview

## Vision Summary

The NeuroCognitive Architecture (NCA) represents a groundbreaking approach to enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with sophisticated, brain-inspired memory capabilities. This project aims to implement a comprehensive three-tiered memory system that mimics human cognitive processes without requiring architectural changes to the underlying LLM models themselves.

The core innovation of NCA lies in its biologically-inspired approach to memory management, incorporating not just storage tiers with different persistence characteristics, but also sophisticated health dynamics, consolidation processes, and relationship networks. This system will enable LLMs to maintain contextual awareness across conversations, develop persistent knowledge structures, and demonstrate more human-like memory characteristics including appropriate forgetting, abstraction, and relationship formation.

By implementing the NCA, we aim to address one of the fundamental limitations of current LLMs: their inability to maintain and evolve memory beyond the immediate context window. This enhancement will dramatically improve the utility of LLMs in applications requiring ongoing interactions, personalization, and knowledge accumulation over time.

# NeuroCognitive Architecture (NCA) Deployment Diagram

## How to Create This Diagram

1. Use a diagramming tool such as:
   - Draw.io (diagrams.net)
   - Lucidchart
   - Microsoft Visio
   - PlantUML with the deployment diagram syntax

2. Create a deployment diagram with the following components:

## Diagram Content

### Cloud Infrastructure Layer
- **AWS Cloud** (or your preferred cloud provider)
  - **VPC** with public and private subnets
  - **Security Groups** for each component
  
### Compute Resources
- **ECS/Kubernetes Cluster**
  - **NCA Core Services** (containerized)
    - Core API Service
    - Memory Management Service
    - Health Dynamics Service
    - LLM Integration Service
  - **Autoscaling Configuration**
  
- **Serverless Components**
  - **Lambda Functions** for event-driven processing
  - **API Gateway** for external API access

### Data Storage
- **Database Tier**
  - **Primary Database** (PostgreSQL RDS)
  - **Read Replicas** for scaling
  - **ElastiCache** for in-memory caching
  
- **Object Storage**
  - **S3 Buckets** for document and model storage
  
- **Memory Tiers**
  - **Working Memory** (ElastiCache Redis)
  - **Short-term Memory** (RDS with time-based policies)
  - **Long-term Memory** (RDS + S3 with archiving)

### Integration Layer
- **LLM Integration**
  - **API Connections** to external LLM providers
  - **Local LLM Deployment** options
  
- **External Services**
  - **Authentication** (Cognito/Auth0)
  - **Monitoring** (CloudWatch/Prometheus/Grafana)
  - **Logging** (CloudWatch Logs/ELK Stack)

### Network Flow
- Show data flow between components with arrows
- Indicate synchronous vs asynchronous communications
- Mark security boundaries and encryption points

### Scaling & Redundancy
- Show redundant components
- Indicate auto-scaling groups
- Mark load balancers and distribution points

### Deployment Regions
- Primary region deployment
- Disaster recovery region (if applicable)
- Edge locations for CDN (if applicable)

## Styling Guidelines
- Use consistent shapes for each component type
- Color-code by component category
- Include a legend explaining symbols and colors
- Use dotted lines for optional components
- Use solid lines for required components
- Add annotations for important deployment considerations

## Export Settings
- Export as PNG with at least 300 DPI resolution
- Use a white background for better readability
- Ensure text is legible at both full size and when zoomed out

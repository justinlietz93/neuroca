' Sequence flow
== User Interaction ==
User -> API: Submit query/request
activate API
API -> Handler: Process request
activate Handler

Handler -> Context: Initialize context
activate Context
Context --> Handler: Context initialized

Handler -> Memory: Retrieve relevant memories
activate Memory

Memory -> WorkingMem: Check working memory
activate WorkingMem
WorkingMem --> Memory: Return active memories

Memory -> EpisodicMem: Query episodic memory
activate EpisodicMem
EpisodicMem --> Memory: Return relevant episodes

Note: This file provides PlantUML code that generates a sequence diagram for the NeuroCognitive Architecture. To generate the actual PNG file:

1. Install PlantUML (https://plantuml.com/starting)
2. Save this code to a file with .puml extension
3. Run: `java -jar plantuml.jar filename.puml` to generate the PNG
4. Alternatively, use an online PlantUML renderer or IDE plugin

The diagram illustrates the flow of information through the NCA system:
- User interaction with the system
- Context initialization and memory retrieval across all three memory tiers
- Health dynamics monitoring
- LLM integration and processing
- Memory updates with new information
- Response formatting and delivery

This sequence diagram should be updated as the architecture evolves to maintain accurate documentation of system interactions.

# NeuroCognitive Architecture (NCA) for LLMs

## Overview

The NeuroCognitive Architecture (NCA) is an advanced framework designed to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) with biologically-inspired cognitive capabilities. By implementing a three-tiered memory system, health dynamics, and neurological components, NCA aims to create more robust, adaptable, and human-like AI systems.

## Key Features

- **Three-Tiered Memory System**: Working memory, episodic memory, and semantic memory integration
- **Health Dynamics**: Simulated biological constraints that influence model performance
- **Neurological Components**: Attention mechanisms, emotional processing, and cognitive control
- **Seamless LLM Integration**: Compatible with leading LLM frameworks and platforms

## Documentation Structure

This documentation is organized to help different stakeholders understand, implement, and extend the NCA system:

- [**Getting Started**](./getting-started.md): Quick setup guide and initial configuration
- [**Architecture Overview**](./architecture/overview.md): High-level system design and components
- [**Core Concepts**](./concepts/index.md): Detailed explanation of NCA's foundational ideas
- [**API Reference**](./api/index.md): Complete API documentation for developers
- [**Memory System**](./memory/index.md): Details on the three-tiered memory implementation
- [**Health Dynamics**](./health/index.md): Documentation on biological constraints and health simulation
- [**Integration Guide**](./integration/index.md): How to integrate NCA with various LLM platforms
- [**Tutorials**](./tutorials/index.md): Step-by-step guides for common tasks
- [**Contributing**](./contributing.md): Guidelines for contributing to the project
- [**FAQ**](./faq.md): Frequently asked questions

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/neuroca.git
cd neuroca

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .

# Or using Poetry
poetry install
```

## Quick Start

```python
from neuroca import NCA
from neuroca.integration import LLMAdapter

# Initialize the NCA system
nca = NCA(config_path="config/default.yaml")

# Connect to your LLM of choice
llm_adapter = LLMAdapter.for_model("gpt-4")
nca.connect(llm_adapter)

# Run a query through the cognitive architecture
response = nca.process("What are the implications of artificial general intelligence?")
print(response)
```

## Project Status

NCA is currently in **Beta** stage. While core functionality is implemented and tested, we're actively refining the system and expanding capabilities. See our [roadmap](./roadmap.md) for upcoming features and improvements.

## Use Cases

- **Enhanced Conversational Agents**: Create chatbots with memory, personality, and adaptive behavior
- **Cognitive Simulation**: Research platform for exploring artificial cognition
- **Personalized AI Assistants**: Assistants that learn and adapt to individual users over time
- **Educational Applications**: Systems that model student learning and adapt teaching strategies
- **Creative Collaboration**: AI partners for creative writing, design, and problem-solving

## Research Foundation

NCA builds upon decades of research in cognitive science, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence. Key influences include:

- Working memory models (Baddeley & Hitch)
- Cognitive architectures (ACT-R, Soar)
- Neuroscience of memory consolidation
- Emotion and cognition interaction theories
- Attention and cognitive control frameworks

## 4. Technology Justification

### Memory Tier Implementation
- **Redis** for STM provides sub-millisecond access times required for the <50ms retrieval target
- **MongoDB** for MTM balances flexibility and performance for the <200ms retrieval target
- **PostgreSQL with pgvector** for LTM offers durability with vector search capabilities
- **Neo4j** provides specialized graph capabilities for relationship-heavy aspects of LTM

### Performance Considerations
- **Rust** components for performance-critical paths ensure minimal latency
- **FAISS** and **pgvector** provide optimized vector operations
- **gRPC** minimizes internal communication overhead
- **Redis** in-memory operations ensure fast STM access

### Scalability Approach
- **Kubernetes** orchestration enables horizontal scaling
- **MongoDB Atlas** provides managed scaling for MTM
- **PostgreSQL** partitioning for LTM data management
- **Celery** and **Ray** for distributed background processing

### Integration Strategy
- **LangChain** simplifies integration with multiple LLM providers
- **FastAPI** provides high-performance API endpoints
- **Pydantic** ensures robust data validation
- **OpenTelemetry** enables comprehensive performance monitoring

This technology stack provides a solid foundation for implementing the NeuroCognitive Architecture while meeting the performance, scalability, and integration requirements specified in the project overview.

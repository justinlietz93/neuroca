This file should be a PNG image containing a component diagram for the NeuroCognitive Architecture (NCA) system. Below are the specifications for creating this diagram:

## Component Diagram Specifications

The diagram should be created using a UML component diagram tool (such as PlantUML, draw.io, Lucidchart, or Enterprise Architect) with the following components and relationships:

### Main Components

1. **API Layer**
   - REST API Controller
   - GraphQL Endpoint
   - WebSocket Service
   - Authentication Service

2. **Core Domain**
   - Cognitive Engine
   - Health Dynamics Manager
   - Attention Mechanism
   - Emotion Processor
   - Decision Making System

3. **Memory System**
   - Working Memory
   - Episodic Memory
   - Semantic Memory
   - Memory Consolidation Service
   - Memory Retrieval Service

4. **LLM Integration**
   - LLM Connector
   - Prompt Engineering Service
   - Response Parser
   - Model Selection Service
   - Context Management

5. **Infrastructure**
   - Database Access Layer
   - Caching Service
   - Message Queue
   - Logging Service
   - Monitoring Service

### Component Relationships

1. The API Layer interfaces with external clients and communicates with the Core Domain
2. The Core Domain orchestrates interactions between Memory System and LLM Integration
3. The Memory System provides storage and retrieval capabilities to the Core Domain
4. The LLM Integration connects to external LLM services and processes requests/responses
5. The Infrastructure provides supporting services to all other components

### Visual Style Guidelines

- Use a consistent color scheme:
  - API Layer: Light Blue
  - Core Domain: Green
  - Memory System: Purple
  - LLM Integration: Orange
  - Infrastructure: Gray

- Include clear component boundaries with proper nesting
- Show interfaces between components with connection points
- Use directional arrows to indicate data/control flow
- Include a legend explaining symbols and color coding
- Use a clean, professional layout with proper spacing

### Additional Notes

- The diagram should be exported at 1920x1080 resolution with transparent background
- Save as PNG format with appropriate compression
- Include the title "NeuroCognitive Architecture - Component Diagram" at the top
- Include a small version number and date in the bottom right corner

This component diagram will serve as a key architectural artifact for understanding the system structure, component responsibilities, and their relationships.

## Overview

NeuroCognitive Architecture (NCA) is a biologically-inspired framework that enhances Large Language Models with a three-tiered memory system, health dynamics, and cognitive processes that mimic human brain functions. NCA enables more contextually aware, adaptive, and human-like AI systems.

### Key Features

- **Three-Tiered Memory System**: Working memory, episodic memory, and semantic memory
- **Health Dynamics**: Simulated fatigue, attention, and cognitive load
- **Biological Inspiration**: Neural activation patterns and cognitive processes
- **Seamless LLM Integration**: Works with popular LLM frameworks

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip or poetry (recommended)
- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)
- Git

## Installation

### Using Poetry (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/neuroca.git
cd neuroca

# Install dependencies with Poetry
poetry install

# Activate the virtual environment
poetry shell
```

### Using pip

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/neuroca.git
cd neuroca

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
```

### Using Docker

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/neuroca.git
cd neuroca

# Build and start the containers
docker-compose up -d
```

## Quick Start

Here's a minimal example to get you started with NCA:

```python
from neuroca import NCA
from neuroca.memory import WorkingMemory, EpisodicMemory, SemanticMemory
from neuroca.integration import LLMConnector

# Initialize the NCA with default settings
nca = NCA()

# Connect to your preferred LLM
llm_connector = LLMConnector(provider="openai", model="gpt-4")
nca.set_llm(llm_connector)

# Process input through the cognitive architecture
response = nca.process("Tell me about the solar system")

print(response)
```

## Core Concepts

### Memory System

NCA implements a three-tiered memory system inspired by human cognition:

1. **Working Memory**: Short-term, limited capacity storage for active processing
   ```python
   from neuroca.memory import WorkingMemory
   
   # Create a working memory with custom capacity
   wm = WorkingMemory(capacity=7)  # Miller's Law: 7Â±2 items
   
   # Add items to working memory
   wm.add("current_topic", "astronomy")
   
   # Retrieve items
   current_topic = wm.get("current_topic")
   ```

2. **Episodic Memory**: Stores experiences and events with temporal context
   ```python
   from neuroca.memory import EpisodicMemory
   
   # Create episodic memory
   em = EpisodicMemory()
   
   # Store an episode
   em.store(
       content="User asked about the solar system",
       context={"timestamp": "2023-10-15T14:30:00", "location": "chat_session_1"}
   )
   
   # Retrieve relevant episodes
   solar_system_episodes = em.retrieve("solar system", limit=5)
   ```

3. **Semantic Memory**: Long-term storage for facts, concepts, and knowledge
   ```python
   from neuroca.memory import SemanticMemory
   
   # Create semantic memory
   sm = SemanticMemory()
   
   # Store knowledge
   sm.store("The solar system has eight planets")
   
   # Query knowledge
   planets_info = sm.query("How many planets in the solar system?")
   ```

### Health Dynamics

NCA models cognitive health factors that affect performance:

```python
from neuroca.core.health import HealthSystem

# Initialize health system
health = HealthSystem()

# Update fatigue after intensive processing
health.update_fatigue(0.1)  # Increase fatigue by 10%

# Check current attention level
attention_level = health.get_attention()

# Apply cognitive rest
health.rest(duration=5)  # Rest for 5 time units
```

## Configuration

NCA can be configured through YAML files or environment variables:

### YAML Configuration

Create a `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
memory:
  working:
    capacity: 10
    decay_rate: 0.2
  episodic:
    max_episodes: 1000
    retrieval_strategy: "relevance"
  semantic:
    embedding_model: "text-embedding-ada-002"
    similarity_threshold: 0.85

health:
  fatigue:
    recovery_rate: 0.05
    max_level: 1.0
  attention:
    base_level: 0.8
    fluctuation_range: 0.2

llm:
  provider: "openai"
  model: "gpt-4"
  temperature: 0.7
  max_tokens: 1000
```

Load the configuration:

```python
from neuroca import NCA
from neuroca.config import load_config

config = load_config("path/to/config.yaml")
nca = NCA(config=config)
```

### Environment Variables

You can also configure NCA using environment variables:

```bash
# Memory settings
export NEUROCA_MEMORY_WORKING_CAPACITY=10
export NEUROCA_MEMORY_EPISODIC_MAX_EPISODES=1000
export NEUROCA_MEMORY_SEMANTIC_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.85

# Health settings
export NEUROCA_HEALTH_FATIGUE_RECOVERY_RATE=0.05
export NEUROCA_HEALTH_ATTENTION_BASE_LEVEL=0.8

# LLM settings
export NEUROCA_LLM_PROVIDER=openai
export NEUROCA_LLM_MODEL=gpt-4
```

## Examples

### Conversation with Memory

```python
from neuroca import NCA

nca = NCA()

# First interaction
response1 = nca.process("My name is Alice")
print(response1)  # Acknowledges the name

# Second interaction (demonstrates memory)
response2 = nca.process("What's my name?")
print(response2)  # Should recall "Alice"

# Complex reasoning with memory
response3 = nca.process("I like astronomy. What topics might interest me?")
print(response3)  # Uses semantic memory to suggest astronomy-related topics
```

### Cognitive Load Simulation

```python
from neuroca import NCA
from neuroca.core.health import HealthSystem

nca = NCA()
health_system = nca.health_system

# Monitor health during complex processing
initial_attention = health_system.get_attention()
print(f"Initial attention: {initial_attention}")

# Process a complex query
response = nca.process("Explain quantum mechanics in detail")

# Check health after processing
post_attention = health_system.get_attention()
fatigue = health_system.get_fatigue()
print(f"Attention after processing: {post_attention}")
print(f"Fatigue level: {fatigue}")

# Apply rest
health_system.rest(duration=10)
print(f"Attention after rest: {health_system.get_attention()}")
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Memory Retrieval Problems

If memory retrieval isn't working as expected:

1. Check memory capacity settings
2. Verify embedding models are properly loaded
3. Adjust similarity thresholds in configuration

```python
# Debug memory retrieval
from neuroca.utils.debugging import debug_memory_retrieval

debug_memory_retrieval(nca.episodic_memory, query="solar system")
```

#### Performance Issues

If you're experiencing slow performance:

1. Reduce memory capacity or retention
2. Use a lighter LLM model
3. Adjust health dynamics parameters

```python
# Performance optimization
nca.config.memory.working.capacity = 5  # Reduce working memory load
nca.config.llm.model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"  # Use a faster model
```

#### API Connection Errors

For LLM integration issues:

1. Verify API keys are correctly set
2. Check network connectivity
3. Ensure rate limits haven't been exceeded

```python
# Test LLM connection
from neuroca.integration import test_llm_connection

test_llm_connection(provider="openai", model="gpt-4")
```

# NeuroCognitive Architecture (NCA) Incident Response Runbook

## Overview

This runbook provides structured guidance for responding to incidents within the NeuroCognitive Architecture (NCA) system. It outlines the procedures, roles, and responsibilities for effectively identifying, containing, resolving, and learning from incidents that affect the NCA platform's availability, performance, or security.

## Incident Severity Levels

| Severity | Description | Response Time | Examples |
|----------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **P0 - Critical** | Complete system outage or severe security breach affecting all users. Business-critical functions unavailable. | Immediate (24/7) | - Complete system unavailability<br>- Data breach exposing sensitive information<br>- Critical memory corruption affecting all LLM interactions |
| **P1 - High** | Major functionality impaired or security issue affecting many users. Significant business impact. | < 1 hour (business hours)<br>< 4 hours (non-business) | - Memory tier failures affecting response quality<br>- API gateway outages<br>- Significant performance degradation |
| **P2 - Medium** | Partial functionality impaired or potential security concern. Limited business impact. | < 4 hours (business hours)<br>< 8 hours (non-business) | - Non-critical component failures<br>- Intermittent errors in specific modules<br>- Degraded performance in specific functions |
| **P3 - Low** | Minor issues with minimal impact. Workarounds available. | < 1 business day | - Cosmetic issues<br>- Minor bugs with easy workarounds<br>- Non-urgent enhancement requests |

## Incident Response Team Roles

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| **Incident Commander (IC)** | - Overall coordination of response<br>- Decision-making authority<br>- Stakeholder communications<br>- Escalation management |
| **Technical Lead** | - Technical investigation<br>- Implementing fixes<br>- Coordinating technical resources<br>- Providing technical updates |
| **Communications Lead** | - Internal/external communications<br>- Status updates<br>- Documentation<br>- Stakeholder management |
| **Subject Matter Experts** | - Specialized knowledge areas (memory systems, LLM integration, etc.)<br>- Technical consultation<br>- Specialized troubleshooting |

## Incident Response Process

### 1. Detection and Reporting

**Objective**: Identify and report potential incidents as quickly as possible.

**Process**:
- Incidents may be detected through:
  - Automated monitoring alerts (Prometheus, Grafana dashboards)
  - Error logs and exception reports
  - User/customer reports
  - Security monitoring tools
- Report incidents through:
  - Incident management system (Jira/PagerDuty)
  - Emergency response channel (#nca-incidents Slack channel)
  - On-call rotation contact

**Tools**:
- Monitoring dashboards: `https://monitoring.neuroca.ai/dashboards`
- Logging system: `https://logs.neuroca.ai`
- Incident reporting form: `https://neuroca.ai/report-incident`

### 2. Triage and Assessment

**Objective**: Quickly assess the incident's severity, scope, and potential impact.

**Process**:
1. Assign initial severity level (P0-P3)
2. Determine affected components and users
3. Identify potential causes
4. Establish incident response team with appropriate roles
5. Create incident channel/ticket for tracking

**Documentation**:
- Document initial assessment in incident management system
- Record timeline of events
- Track all actions taken

### 3. Containment

**Objective**: Limit the impact and prevent escalation of the incident.

**Process**:
1. Implement immediate mitigation measures:
   - Service isolation
   - Traffic rerouting
   - Feature flags/toggles
   - Rollback to previous stable version
2. Apply temporary fixes if available
3. Communicate status to affected stakeholders
4. Continuously monitor for changes in incident scope

**Common Containment Strategies**:
- For memory corruption: Isolate affected memory tier and route to backup
- For API issues: Implement circuit breakers or rate limiting
- For security incidents: Block compromised access points, rotate credentials

### 4. Investigation and Diagnosis

**Objective**: Determine root cause and develop comprehensive solution.

**Process**:
1. Gather relevant logs, metrics, and system state information
2. Analyze data to identify patterns and anomalies
3. Reproduce issue in non-production environment if possible
4. Consult relevant documentation and known issues
5. Engage subject matter experts as needed

**Investigation Checklist**:
- Review recent deployments or changes
- Check infrastructure status (cloud provider, network, etc.)
- Analyze error logs and exception reports
- Review memory tier integrity and performance metrics
- Verify LLM integration points

### 5. Resolution

**Objective**: Implement and verify permanent fix.

**Process**:
1. Develop solution addressing root cause
2. Test solution in non-production environment
3. Create implementation plan with rollback procedures
4. Deploy fix with appropriate approvals
5. Verify resolution through monitoring and testing
6. Return system to normal operation

**Verification Steps**:
- Confirm all affected components are operational
- Verify performance metrics have returned to normal
- Ensure no new issues have been introduced
- Validate with end-users if appropriate

### 6. Post-Incident Activities

**Objective**: Learn from the incident and improve system resilience.

**Process**:
1. Conduct post-incident review meeting (within 5 business days)
2. Document incident timeline, actions, and outcomes
3. Identify preventive measures and improvements
4. Create follow-up action items with owners and deadlines
5. Update documentation and runbooks based on lessons learned
6. Share findings with relevant teams

**Post-Incident Review Template**:
- Incident summary and timeline
- Root cause analysis
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items with owners and deadlines

## Common Incident Scenarios and Responses

### Memory Tier Failures

**Symptoms**:
- Degraded response quality
- Increased latency in responses
- Memory retrieval errors in logs

**Initial Response**:
1. Identify affected memory tier (working, episodic, semantic)
2. Check memory tier health metrics in monitoring dashboard
3. Verify database connectivity and performance
4. Implement failover to backup memory systems if available

**Resolution Steps**:
1. Restore from backup if corruption detected
2. Repair index inconsistencies
3. Scale resources if capacity issues identified
4. Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures

### LLM Integration Issues

**Symptoms**:
- Failed API calls to LLM provider
- Timeout errors
- Unexpected response formats
- Cost spikes

**Initial Response**:
1. Check LLM provider status page
2. Verify API credentials and rate limits
3. Review recent changes to integration code
4. Implement fallback to alternative LLM if available

**Resolution Steps**:
1. Update integration code to handle API changes
2. Adjust timeout and retry configurations
3. Implement request caching if appropriate
4. Review and optimize prompt engineering

### Security Incidents

**Symptoms**:
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Unusual traffic patterns
- Data exfiltration alerts
- Unexpected system behavior

**Initial Response**:
1. Isolate affected systems
2. Revoke compromised credentials
3. Block suspicious IP addresses
4. Preserve evidence for investigation

**Resolution Steps**:
1. Conduct security assessment
2. Patch vulnerabilities
3. Implement additional security controls
4. Review and update security policies

## Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive monitoring and observability strategy for the NeuroCognitive Architecture (NCA) system. Effective monitoring is critical for ensuring the reliability, performance, and health of the NCA system, particularly given its complex, biologically-inspired architecture and integration with Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Monitoring Philosophy

The NCA monitoring approach follows these core principles:

1. **Holistic Observability**: Monitor all aspects of the system - from infrastructure to application performance to cognitive processes.
2. **Proactive Detection**: Identify potential issues before they impact users or system performance.
3. **Cognitive Health Metrics**: Track specialized metrics related to the NCA's cognitive functions and health dynamics.
4. **Data-Driven Operations**: Use monitoring data to drive continuous improvement and optimization.
5. **Minimal Overhead**: Implement monitoring with minimal impact on system performance.

## Monitoring Architecture

The NCA monitoring architecture consists of the following components:

## Alerting Strategy

Alerts are categorized by severity and impact:

1. **Critical (P1)**: Immediate response required; system is down or severely degraded
   - Example: Memory system failure, API gateway unavailable, database connectivity lost

2. **High (P2)**: Urgent response required; significant functionality impacted
   - Example: High error rates, severe performance degradation, memory tier failures

3. **Medium (P3)**: Response required within business hours; partial functionality impacted
   - Example: Increased latency, non-critical component failures, resource warnings

4. **Low (P4)**: Response can be scheduled; minimal impact on functionality
   - Example: Minor performance issues, non-critical warnings, capacity planning alerts

### Alert Routing

Alerts are routed based on component ownership and on-call schedules. The primary notification channels include:

- PagerDuty for critical and high-priority alerts
- Slack for all alert levels with appropriate channel routing
- Email for medium and low-priority alerts
- SMS/phone calls for critical alerts requiring immediate attention

## Logging Framework

The NCA system implements a structured logging approach with the following components:

1. **Log Levels**:
   - ERROR: System errors requiring immediate attention
   - WARN: Potential issues that don't impact immediate functionality
   - INFO: Normal operational information
   - DEBUG: Detailed information for troubleshooting
   - TRACE: Highly detailed tracing information for development

2. **Log Structure**:
   - Timestamp (ISO 8601 format)
   - Log level
   - Service/component name
   - Request ID (for distributed tracing)
   - Message
   - Contextual metadata (JSON format)

3. **Log Storage and Retention**:
   - Hot storage: 7 days for quick access
   - Warm storage: 30 days for recent historical analysis
   - Cold storage: 1 year for compliance and long-term analysis

4. **Log Processing Pipeline**:
   - Collection via Fluentd/Fluent Bit
   - Processing and enrichment via Logstash
   - Storage in Elasticsearch
   - Visualization in Kibana

## Distributed Tracing

Distributed tracing is implemented using OpenTelemetry to track requests as they flow through the NCA system:

   - Database queries and external API calls
   - Memory tier operations
   - Cognitive process execution

3. **Trace Visualization**:
   - Jaeger UI for trace exploration
   - Grafana for trace-to-metrics correlation
   - Custom dashboards for cognitive process tracing

## Health Checks

The NCA system implements multi-level health checks:

1. **Liveness Probes**: Determine if a component should be restarted
   - Basic connectivity checks
   - Process health verification

2. **Readiness Probes**: Determine if a component can receive traffic
   - Dependency availability checks
   - Resource availability verification

3. **Cognitive Health Checks**: Specialized for NCA components
   - Memory system integrity checks
   - Cognitive process functionality tests
   - Health dynamics parameter verification

## Dashboards

The following dashboards are available for monitoring the NCA system:

1. **System Overview**: High-level health and performance of all components
2. **Memory System**: Detailed metrics for all memory tiers
3. **Cognitive Processes**: Performance and health of reasoning, learning, and decision-making
4. **LLM Integration**: Token usage, performance, and integration health
5. **Health Dynamics**: Energy levels, stress indicators, and adaptation metrics
6. **API Performance**: Request rates, latencies, and error rates by endpoint
7. **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, disk, and network usage across the system
8. **Alerts and Incidents**: Current and historical alert data and incident metrics

## Incident Response

The incident response process follows these steps:

1. **Detection**: Automated alert or manual discovery
2. **Triage**: Assess severity and impact
3. **Response**: Engage appropriate team members
4. **Mitigation**: Implement immediate fixes to restore service
5. **Resolution**: Apply permanent fixes
6. **Post-Mortem**: Analyze root cause and identify improvements
7. **Documentation**: Update runbooks and knowledge base

### Incident Severity Levels

- **SEV1**: Complete system outage or data loss
- **SEV2**: Major functionality unavailable or severe performance degradation
- **SEV3**: Minor functionality impacted or moderate performance issues
- **SEV4**: Cosmetic issues or minor bugs with minimal impact

## Capacity Planning

Capacity planning is based on the following metrics and processes:

1. **Resource Utilization Trends**:
   - CPU, memory, disk, and network usage patterns
   - Database growth and query patterns
   - Memory tier utilization and growth rates

2. **Scaling Thresholds**:
   - Horizontal scaling triggers (e.g., CPU > 70%, memory > 80%)
   - Vertical scaling assessments (quarterly)
   - Database scaling and sharding planning

3. **Forecasting Models**:
   - Linear regression for basic resource growth
   - Seasonal decomposition for cyclical patterns

### Logging Configuration

Example Fluentd configuration for log collection:

```
<source>
  @type forward
  port 24224
  bind 0.0.0.0
</source>

<filter **>
  @type record_transformer
  <record>
    hostname ${hostname}
    environment ${ENV["ENVIRONMENT"]}
  </record>
</filter>

<match **>
  @type elasticsearch
  host elasticsearch
  port 9200
  logstash_format true
  logstash_prefix nca-logs
  flush_interval 5s
</match>
```

## Best Practices

1. **Instrumentation Guidelines**:
   - Use consistent naming conventions for metrics
   - Instrument all critical paths and components
   - Add context to logs for easier troubleshooting
   - Use appropriate log levels to avoid noise

2. **Alert Design**:
   - Alert on symptoms, not causes
   - Set appropriate thresholds to minimize false positives
   - Include actionable information in alert messages
   - Implement alert suppression for maintenance windows

3. **Dashboard Design**:
   - Start with high-level overview, drill down for details
   - Group related metrics for easier correlation
   - Use consistent color coding for severity levels
   - Include links to runbooks and documentation

4. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Sample high-cardinality metrics appropriately
   - Use log levels effectively to control volume
   - Implement rate limiting for high-volume log sources
   - Consider the overhead of distributed tracing in production

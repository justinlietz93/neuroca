# NeuroCognitive Architecture (NCA) for LLMs - Project Overview

## Vision Summary

The NeuroCognitive Architecture (NCA) project aims to revolutionize how Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with memory by implementing a brain-inspired three-tiered memory system. Unlike existing approaches that either modify LLM architecture or implement simplistic vector stores, NCA creates a sophisticated cognitive framework that mimics human memory processes.

This system will enable LLMs to maintain contextual awareness across multiple time horizons, form complex relationship networks between concepts, and dynamically manage information based on relevance, importance, and usage patterns. By implementing biological memory concepts like health dynamics, consolidation processes, and neural pathways, NCA will provide LLMs with more human-like memory capabilities without requiring changes to the underlying model architecture.

## Project Objectives

1. **Implement a Three-Tiered Memory System**
   - Develop a Short-Term Memory (STM) using in-memory databases for immediate context
   - Create a Medium-Term Memory (MTM) using document stores for intermediate persistence
   - Build a Long-Term Memory (LTM) using persistent databases for durable knowledge

2. **Develop a Comprehensive Memory Health System**
   - Implement health metadata tracking for all memory items
   - Create algorithms for health calculation, decay, and tier transitions
   - Design strategic forgetting mechanisms to prevent information overload

3. **Create Advanced Biological Memory Components**
   - Build a Memory Lymphatic System for background consolidation
   - Implement Neural Tubule Networks for relationship mapping
   - Develop a Temporal Annealing Scheduler for optimized processing

4. **Design a Seamless LLM Integration Layer**
   - Create context-aware retrieval without explicit triggers

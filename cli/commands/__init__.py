"""
NeuroCognitive Architecture (NCA) CLI Commands Package.

This package contains all command-line interface commands for the NeuroCognitive Architecture system.
It provides a structured way to interact with the NCA system through the command line, enabling
operations such as system initialization, memory management, health monitoring, and more.

The commands are organized into logical groups based on their functionality and are designed
to be composable and extensible. Each command follows consistent patterns for argument parsing,
error handling, and output formatting.

Usage:
    Import specific commands or command groups as needed:
    ```python
    from neuroca.cli.commands import memory_commands, health_commands
    ```

    Or access all available commands through the ALL_COMMANDS dictionary:
    ```python
    from neuroca.cli.commands import ALL_COMMANDS
    ```

Note:
    This module serves as the entry point for all CLI commands and should maintain
    backward compatibility when adding or modifying commands.

Security:
    All user inputs through CLI commands are validated and sanitized to prevent
    injection attacks or other security vulnerabilities.

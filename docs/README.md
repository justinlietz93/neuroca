# NeuroCognitive Architecture (NCA) for LLMs

## Overview

The NeuroCognitive Architecture (NCA) is an advanced framework designed to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) with biologically-inspired cognitive capabilities. NCA implements a three-tiered memory system, health dynamics, and neurological components that enable more human-like reasoning, contextual understanding, and adaptive behavior in AI systems.

## Features

- **Three-Tiered Memory System**
  - Working memory for active processing
  - Episodic memory for experiential storage
  - Semantic memory for conceptual knowledge

- **Health Dynamics**
  - Simulated biological constraints
  - Energy management systems
  - Performance adaptation based on system state

- **Biological-Inspired Components**
  - Neural pathway simulation
  - Cognitive load modeling
  - Attention mechanisms

- **LLM Integration**
  - Seamless connection with popular LLM frameworks
  - Enhanced context management
  - Improved reasoning capabilities

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)
- Access to LLM APIs (if using external models)

### Using Poetry (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neuroca.git
cd neuroca

# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

### Using Docker

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neuroca.git
cd neuroca

# Build and start containers
docker-compose up -d

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

```python
from neuroca.core import NeuroCognitiveArchitecture
from neuroca.integration import LLMConnector

# Initialize the architecture
nca = NeuroCognitiveArchitecture()

# Connect to your preferred LLM
llm_connector = LLMConnector(provider="openai", model="gpt-4")
nca.connect_llm(llm_connector)

# Process input with enhanced cognitive capabilities
response = nca.process("Explain the relationship between quantum physics and consciousness")
print(response)
```

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Run a simple interaction
neuroca-cli chat

# Process a file with enhanced reasoning
neuroca-cli process --input document.txt --output analysis.json

# Monitor system health
neuroca-cli status
```

## API Documentation

The NCA provides a RESTful API for integration with other systems:

### Endpoints

- `POST /api/v1/process` - Process text input through the cognitive architecture
- `GET /api/v1/memory` - Retrieve current memory state
- `GET /api/v1/health` - Get system health metrics
- `POST /api/v1/learn` - Add new information to semantic memory

For detailed API documentation, see the [API Reference](docs/api-reference.md).

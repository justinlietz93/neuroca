"""
API Routes Module for NeuroCognitive Architecture (NCA)

This module initializes and configures all API routes for the NCA system.
It provides a function to register routes with the FastAPI application
and organizes route modules in a structured way.

The module follows a modular approach where each domain has its own router
that is registered with the main application. This allows for better organization,
maintainability, and testability of the API endpoints.

Usage:
    from fastapi import FastAPI
    from neuroca.api.routes import register_routes
    
    app = FastAPI()
    register_routes(app)
